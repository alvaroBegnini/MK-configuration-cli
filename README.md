# MK-configuration-cli
This is a program made for configuration of wireless devices in the ISP where i currently work

# How to use it
to use it you'll have to configure a Router Board (i'm using MikroTik hAP lite). Set 2 ips in the port that you will conect your wireless device (192.168.88.2/24 and 192.168.10.2/24)
after it just configure your .env file with the wireless password, user and password of RB.
then just execute ```configure``` in the terminal in the project folder
